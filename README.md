# lunch-party
CB Hackathon 9/18/2014

This was done with little sleep and a lot of caffine in the span of 24 hours, so don't jugdge too harshly.

Small rails app that can pair users for a lunch party based on their preference of food. Uses CB's hipchat to validate users and message them when their party is ready.
